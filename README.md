# ðŸŽ®  Minelin
A full minecraft server written from scratch in kotlin - gives you the ability to write plugins for it.

### ðŸ§° Why would I use Minelin?
There is **no** need to use Minelin. If you're reading this, the whole project is unstable, probably you won't be able to run it. Even with a stable build I dont think, that this project will be able to replace any other server out there.
